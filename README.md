# MTG-Primer-Blurb

A program designed to create high resolution images to act as deck primers for decks in the Canadian Highlander format of the card game Magic: The Gathering. The images are designed to be use in conjunction with makeplayingcards.com in order to have custom cards which are stylish, portable, and informative.

For instructions on using and setting up this program, see [the instructions PDF](./MTG-Automated-Primers-Instructions.pdf).
